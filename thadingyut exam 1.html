	<h1> How to celebrate Thadingyut festival? <br>
	<img src="thadingyut_1.jpg" alt="Thadingyut" style="width: 500px; height: 150px;"></h1>
	<p style="padding-left: 20px;">During Thadingyut, pagodas and homes through the country are decorated with electric lights, colorful paper lanterns, candles and even small ceramic saucers filled with oill in which wicis are lit. Major religious sites such as Shwedagon Pagoda are packed with pilgrims who light candles to pay homage to the Buddha and gain merit. Each light adds to the incredible spectacle of thousands of small flames burning in the night. Out on the streets, meanwhile, some people light fireworks or launch small hot-air balloons, which silently ascend and drift across the sky before burning out.</p>
